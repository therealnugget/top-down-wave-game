An extension of the physics system i made in c++.
The current commit is the latest working version so feel free to check it out.
To play the game, run "top-down-wave-game.exe".
The physics system was built using a quadtree for the broadphase and SAT for the narrow phase with linear impulse collision responses. SDL2 was used for rendering. 
Press "WASD" to move, "O" to rotate and "SPACE" to attack (although attacking doesn't currently do anything.
